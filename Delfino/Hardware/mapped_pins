Use this file as a running "reservation" of header pins. 
If you know a module will be using a specific interface,
(probably the ones we went over already), list the pins being used under that device.

example:
***************
  LCD (GPIO):
    Pin 1 -> uP pin 3
    Pin 2 -> uP pin 15
    Pin 3 -> uP pin 12
    Pin 4 -> uP pin 2
    Pin 5 -> uP pin 1
    Pin 6 -> uP pin 18
    Pin 7 -> uP pin 7
    Pin 8 -> uP pin 67
***************
